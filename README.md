# About Me

> Hi, I'm Jayr ‚Äî a web developer and a project manager with a passion for crafting websites that are as functional as they
> are beautiful. My journey in the web development world started back in 2011 when I took on the role of operations manager
> at a small web design agency in Cebu, Philippines. It was there that I discovered my love for turning ideas into digital
> realities.
>
> In 2016, I stepped into the role of project manager at Blaze Commerce, where I led teams in building everything from
> small business sites to complex e-commerce platforms. Fast forward to 2022, I packed my bags and moved to Canada to
> pursue a Web Development diploma at Conestoga College. During this time, my focus sharpened on creating websites with a
> seamless user experience (UX) and intuitive design (UI).
>
> Now, I'm on a mission to keep building impactful websites, one project at a time.
